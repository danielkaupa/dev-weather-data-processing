It is the sum of large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. See further information. This parameter does not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth.\n\nThis parameter is the total amount of water accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box.\n\nCare should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.

The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms.\n\nThis parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm:\nParameter value Thunderstorm Probability\n<20 K No thunderstorm.\n20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms.\n26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms.\n31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms.\n>35 K Numerous thunderstorms",
